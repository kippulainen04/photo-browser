## üöÄ Overview
This is a training spec for a photo browsing web application. The goal the application is to render a simple grid of images and allow navigation from each image to a details page.

The application should use JSONPlaceholder as a source for the photo content by implementing ReactJs, React router, Redux-toolkit, along with Typescript and testing. Redux-toolkit in this project plays a vital role as a global state management to manage the CRUD requests smoothier and easier.

In this project, besides **[HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#:~:text=The%20HyperText%20Markup%20Language%20or,(HyperText%20Markup%20Language)), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS), [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)**, and **[ReactJs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library))**, **Redux-toolkit** is applied to empower a multitude of tools to simplify asynchronous state management. Additionally, **[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)** is applied to implement E2E testing using a browser and a testing library for the UI of front-end.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Learning Objectives

After fulfilling the project, I acquire knowledge to:
* Build and style dynamic webpages with semantic **HTML** and **CSS** and **Javascript** with **ReactJs** library on top
* Use **Eslint** to check nested elements, indentation, comments, and line breaks
* Implement **Cypress** for E2E testing
* Use `redux-persist` to store the state in the localstorage
* Implement the use of ReactJs for DOM manipulation and minify the files of our project with the help of Webpack from `create-react-app`
* Implement the use of **styled-component** and **Google font**, to advance the styling of the project and implement **Google's Material Design** concept
* Implement the use of `.jsx` extension to build reuseable component for user interfact, along with `React hooks`
* Implement the use of **CRUD** requests from `createAsyncThunk`
* Perform common commands via the command line to interface with the operating system, such as navigating the file tree and creating, opening and comitting the file and directory to github
* Use **Git workflow** to initialize projects, track changes, and host via remote server
* Execute live deployment using **GitHub** Pages

## üìã Requirements

**Build a React application that fulfil some requirements:**

* The application must use React
* The application must run on the latest Chrome version
* Get the images from here
* The source code must be made available somehow

**Optional requirement:**

* Use TypeScript
* Use some kind of state management, preferably Mobx or Redux. Either one is good.
* Create individual routes for each of the views. Make sure that browser navigation works flawlessly
* Use CSS-in-JS (Styled Components, Emotion, Radium, etc.)
* Use function components and hooks instead of class components
* The demo is accessible on the internet
* Write a couple of simple tests using Jest or a testing framework of your choice
* The source code has a README.MD detailing how to run the code locally
* User should see an error message, if something goes wrong with API. Implement simple error handling. No need to differentiate between error types.

## ‚ö° Installation & Usage

1. Cloning the project & rendering on your local browser
* The respository can be [cloned](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) as other github repository 
* Then `npm install` & `npm start` runs the app in the development mode - Open [http://localhost:3000]

2. Using the live code
* Open your webbrowser
* Then add [this link](https://photos-browser.netlify.app/) to your browser
